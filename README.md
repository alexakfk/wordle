<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The game Wordle, now owned by the New York Times, has closely bonded my family and I over these past few months. As a boarding student, I have limited contact with my family, so being able to play wordle every morning has become something I really enjoy. For that reason, I have decided to try to code my own as a project for school. My background in JavaScript, however, is limited, so all of the help I can get is trully appreciated!

### Installation

Since it's a simple project, all you need to install it is an IDE that can run JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files. If you have that, feel free to copy the repo!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Get User Input Working
- [ ] Block User Input (five characters per row), and figure out how Enter and Backspace might work
- [ ] Conditionals that check similarity per letter
- [ ] Add API's that select a new random word each day, and that can verify if the word inputed by user is real
